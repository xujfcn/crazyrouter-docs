# Responses API Overview

The Responses API is OpenAI's next-generation API format, designed to simplify the development experience for multi-step tasks and tool calling. Crazyrouter fully supports the Responses API.

## Responses API vs Chat Completions API

| Feature | Responses API | Chat Completions API |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| Endpoint | `/v1/responses` | `/v1/chat/completions` |
| Message format | `input` (string or array) | `messages` (array) |
| Tool calling | Built-in support, automatic context management | Requires manual message history management |
| Streaming format | Rich event types | Simple delta format |
| Thinking mode | `reasoning` parameter | `reasoning_effort` parameter |
| Web search | Built-in `web_search` tool | Via `tools` parameter |
| Compatibility | Newer, supported by some models | Broadly supported by all models |

## When to Use Responses API

Suitable for the following scenarios:
- Need built-in tools (web search, file search)
- Multi-step tasks and complex tool calling
- Need rich streaming events
- Using advanced features of newer models like GPT-5

## When to Use Chat Completions API

Suitable for the following scenarios:
- Need the broadest model compatibility
- Simple conversations and text generation
- Existing code based on Chat Completions
- Using non-OpenAI models (Claude, Gemini, etc.)

## Quick Comparison Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Responses API">
    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI(
        api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
        base_url="https://crazyrouter.com/v1"
    )

    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        input="Explain what a REST API is"
    )

    print(response.output_text)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Chat Completions API">
    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI(
        api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
        base_url="https://crazyrouter.com/v1"
    )

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "Explain what a REST API is"}
        ]
    )

    print(response.choices[0].message.content)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  Both APIs can be used together in the same project. Crazyrouter provides full support for both formats, and you can choose the appropriate API based on your specific needs.
