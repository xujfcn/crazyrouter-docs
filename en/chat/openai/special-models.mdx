# Special Models

Crazyrouter provides some models with special capabilities. They are called through the standard Chat Completions API but have specific usage patterns.

### Response Example

```json

  "object": "chat.completion",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Text content in the image:\n\nInvoice Number: 12345678\nDate: February 20, 2026\nAmount: $1,280.00\n..."
      },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ]
}

<Note>
  Extra parameters for special models (such as `translation`) are non-standard extensions by Crazyrouter. Standard OpenAI SDKs may not directly support them. You can pass them via `extra_body` or use HTTP requests directly.
