# Get Seed

```
GET /mj/task/{id}/image-seed
```

Get the image seed value of a completed task. The seed can be used to reproduce similar generation results.

## Request Examples

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://crazyrouter.com/mj/task/task_1234567890/image-seed \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://crazyrouter.com/mj/task/task_1234567890/image-seed",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
)

print(response.json())
```

</CodeGroup>

## Response Example

```json
{
  "code": 1,
  "description": "Success",
  "result": "1234567890"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `result` | Seed value, can be used in Imagine prompts with `--seed 1234567890` to reproduce results |

---

## Using the Seed

Add the `--seed` parameter to the prompt in an Imagine request:

```json
{
  "prompt": "a beautiful sunset over the ocean --ar 16:9 --v 6 --seed 1234567890"
}
```

<Note>
  The seed can only be retrieved after a task has completed successfully. The same seed + same prompt will generate very similar (but not identical) images.
