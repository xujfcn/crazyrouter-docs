# Midjourney Overview

Crazyrouter provides a complete Midjourney API proxy, supporting all operations including Imagine, Blend, Describe, Upscale, Variation, and more. All requests are processed asynchronously via tasks.

## Base Path

```
https://crazyrouter.com/mj
```

## Authentication

Pass your API Key in the request header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

---

## Task Object

Each Midjourney request submission returns a task object. The task object contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique task identifier |
| `action` | string | Task type: `IMAGINE`, `UPSCALE`, `VARIATION`, `BLEND`, `DESCRIBE`, etc. |
| `status` | string | Task status |
| `prompt` | string | Submitted prompt |
| `promptEn` | string | Translated English prompt |
| `description` | string | Task description |
| `submitTime` | number | Submission time (millisecond timestamp) |
| `startTime` | number | Processing start time |
| `finishTime` | number | Completion time |
| `progress` | string | Progress percentage, e.g. `"100%"` |
| `imageUrl` | string | Generated image URL |
| `failReason` | string | Failure reason (only present on failure) |
| `properties` | object | Additional properties |
| `buttons` | array | List of available action buttons |

---

## Task Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `NOT_START` | Task submitted, waiting to be processed |
| `SUBMITTED` | Task submitted to Midjourney |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | Task is being processed |
| `SUCCESS` | Task completed |
| `FAILURE` | Task failed |

---

## Action Buttons

After a task completes, the `buttons` field contains available follow-up actions:

```json
{
  "buttons": [
    {"customId": "MJ::JOB::upsample::1::hash", "emoji": "U1", "label": "U1", "style": 2},
    {"customId": "MJ::JOB::upsample::2::hash", "emoji": "U2", "label": "U2", "style": 2},
    {"customId": "MJ::JOB::upsample::3::hash", "emoji": "U3", "label": "U3", "style": 2},
    {"customId": "MJ::JOB::upsample::4::hash", "emoji": "U4", "label": "U4", "style": 2},
    {"customId": "MJ::JOB::variation::1::hash", "emoji": "V1", "label": "V1", "style": 2},
    {"customId": "MJ::JOB::variation::2::hash", "emoji": "V2", "label": "V2", "style": 2},
    {"customId": "MJ::JOB::variation::3::hash", "emoji": "V3", "label": "V3", "style": 2},
    {"customId": "MJ::JOB::variation::4::hash", "emoji": "V4", "label": "V4", "style": 2}
  ]
}
```

Use the `customId` to call the Action endpoint to perform the corresponding operation (upscale, variation, etc.).

## API Endpoints Overview

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/mj/submit/imagine` | Submit an Imagine task |
| POST | `/mj/submit/action` | Execute an action (upscale, variation, etc.) |
| POST | `/mj/submit/blend` | Blend images |
| POST | `/mj/submit/describe` | Describe an image |
| POST | `/mj/submit/modal` | Submit modal confirmation |
| POST | `/mj/submit/shorten` | Shorten a prompt |
| GET | `/mj/task/{id}/fetch` | Query a single task |
| POST | `/mj/task/list-by-condition` | Batch query tasks |
| GET | `/mj/task/{id}/image-seed` | Get image seed |

<Note>
  Midjourney tasks are processed asynchronously. After submission, you need to poll the task status. It is recommended to query every 3-5 seconds until the status becomes `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`.
