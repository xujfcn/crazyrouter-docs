## Overview

Crazyrouter provides an image upload endpoint that supports uploading images to the built-in image host. After uploading, it returns an accessible image URL that can be used for vision, image editing, and other API calls.

## Built-in Image Host

### Request

```
POST /api/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer sk-xxx
```

<ParamField body="file" type="file" required>
  Image file. Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP.
</ParamField>

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "",
  "data": "https://crazyrouter.com/uploads/2026/01/abc123.png"
}
```

## Code Examples

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://crazyrouter.com/api/upload"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer sk-xxx"
}

with open("image.png", "rb") as f:
    response = requests.post(
        url,
        headers=headers,
        files={"file": ("image.png", f, "image/png")}
    )

data = response.json()
image_url = data["data"]
print(f"Image URL: {image_url}")
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://crazyrouter.com/api/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-xxx" \
  -F "file=@image.png"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Using with Vision

After uploading an image, you can use the returned URL with GPT-4o vision:

```python
# Upload the image first
upload_resp = requests.post(
    "https://crazyrouter.com/api/upload",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer sk-xxx"},
    files={"file": open("photo.jpg", "rb")}
)
image_url = upload_resp.json()["data"]

# Then call the vision API
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="sk-xxx", base_url="https://crazyrouter.com/v1")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image"},
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": image_url}}
        ]
    }]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Self-Hosted Image Storage

If you need to use your own image hosting, you can configure the image host API address in the system settings. S3-compatible object storage services are supported.

<Note>
  The upload file size limit is 20MB. It is recommended to compress images before uploading to save storage space and speed up transfers.
