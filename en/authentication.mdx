## Bearer Token Authentication

All API requests require an API Key in the header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Getting an API Key

1. Log in to [Crazyrouter](https://crazyrouter.com)
2. Go to the [Token Management](https://crazyrouter.com/token) page
3. Click "Create Token"
4. Set the token name, quota limit, available models, etc.
5. Copy the generated key starting with `sk-`

<Warning>
The API Key is only displayed once at creation time. Please save it securely. If lost, you will need to create a new one.
</Warning>

## Usage Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://crazyrouter.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-xxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}]}'
```

```python Python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-xxxxxxxx",
    base_url="https://crazyrouter.com/v1"
)
```

```javascript Node.js
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: 'sk-xxxxxxxx',
  baseURL: 'https://crazyrouter.com/v1'
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Token Permission Controls

When creating a token, you can configure:

- **Name**: For easy identification of its purpose
- **Quota Limit**: Set the maximum available quota
- **Expiration Time**: Set a validity period
- **Available Models**: Restrict which models can be called
- **IP Whitelist**: Restrict the source IPs allowed to make calls
