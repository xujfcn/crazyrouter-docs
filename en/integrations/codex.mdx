## Overview

OpenAI Codex CLI is OpenAI's official command-line programming assistant that supports AI-assisted programming in the terminal.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://crazyrouter.com/v1
```

### Launch

```bash
codex
```

### Specify Model

```bash
codex --model gpt-4o
```

## Configuration File

Create `~/.codex/config.json`:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "apiKey": "sk-xxx",
  "baseURL": "https://crazyrouter.com/v1"
}
```

<Note>
  Codex CLI uses the OpenAI format by default, which Crazyrouter fully supports. Just change the Base URL and API Key.
