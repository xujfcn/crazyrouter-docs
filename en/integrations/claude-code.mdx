## Overview

Claude Code is Anthropic's official command-line AI programming assistant. You can connect it to Crazyrouter by configuring environment variables.

## Configuration

### Set Environment Variables

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux / macOS">
    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://crazyrouter.com
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-xxx
    ```

    Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for persistence:

    ```bash
    echo 'export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://crazyrouter.com' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-xxx' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows (PowerShell)">
    ```powershell
    $env:ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL = "https://crazyrouter.com"
    $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-xxx"
    ```

    Set permanently:

    ```powershell
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL", "https://crazyrouter.com", "User")
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "sk-xxx", "User")
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Launch Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

## Verification

After launching, enter any question. If you get a normal response, the configuration is successful.

<Note>
  Claude Code uses the Anthropic native API format (`/v1/messages`), which Crazyrouter fully supports. Note that the Base URL should not include the `/v1` suffix.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Make sure your token has Claude models enabled (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`).
</Warning>
