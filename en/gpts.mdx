## Overview

Crazyrouter supports calling OpenAI GPTs (custom GPT applications) through the standard Chat Completions API. Simply set the model name to the GPTs-specific format.

## Model Name Format

```
gpt-4-gizmo-{gizmo_id}
```

The `gizmo_id` is the unique identifier for the GPT, which can be extracted from the GPTs URL.

## Getting the Gizmo ID

1. Visit the [ChatGPT GPTs Store](https://chatgpt.com/gpts)
2. Open the target GPT application
3. Extract the ID from the URL: `https://chatgpt.com/g/g-B3hgivKK9-xxx` → ID is `g-B3hgivKK9`

## Code Examples

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-xxx",
    base_url="https://crazyrouter.com/v1"
)

# Chat with a GPT
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-gizmo-g-B3hgivKK9",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, please introduce yourself"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://crazyrouter.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-xxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4-gizmo-g-B3hgivKK9",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, please introduce yourself"}
    ]
  }'
```

<Warning>
  GPTs calls require upstream channel support. Not all GPTs are available - availability depends on channel configuration.
</Warning>

<Note>
  GPTs conversations support streaming output by setting `stream: true`. Billing is calculated based on GPT-4 model pricing.
