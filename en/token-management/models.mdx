title: 'Get Token Models'
description: 'Query the list of models available to a specific token'
api: 'GET /api/token/models'
---

## Overview

Get the list of models that the current token (API Key) can access. If the token has no model restrictions, all enabled system models are returned.

## Authentication

Authenticate using an API Key (sk-xxx):

```
Authorization: Bearer sk-xxx
```

## Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    "gpt-4o",
    "gpt-4o-mini",
    "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "gemini-2.5-pro",
    "text-embedding-3-large"
  ]
}
```

## Code Examples

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-xxx",
    base_url="https://crazyrouter.com/v1"
)

# Get model list via OpenAI SDK
models = client.models.list()
for model in models.data:
    print(model.id)
```

```python Python (requests)
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://crazyrouter.com/v1/models",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer sk-xxx"}
)

models = response.json()["data"]
for model in models:
    print(model["id"])
```

```bash cURL
curl https://crazyrouter.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-xxx"
```

<Note>
  You can also use the OpenAI-compatible `GET /v1/models` endpoint to get the model list, which works the same way.
