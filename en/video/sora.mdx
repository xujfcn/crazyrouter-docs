  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{

}
```

```

Create reusable characters to maintain consistency across videos.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://crazyrouter.com/sora/v1/characters \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Luna",
    "description": "A young woman with long silver hair and blue eyes",
    "reference_images": ["https://example.com/character_ref.jpg"]
  }'
```

## Storyboard Support

Define multi-scene videos using storyboards:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://crazyrouter.com/v1/videos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "sora",
    "storyboard": [
      {
        "prompt": "A sunrise over the mountains",
        "duration": 5
      },
      {
        "prompt": "Camera pans down to reveal a village",
        "duration": 5
      },
      {
        "prompt": "Close-up of a farmer starting their day",
        "duration": 5
      }
    ],
    "size": "1920x1080"
  }'
```

---

## Query Task

```
GET /v1/videos/{task_id}
```

```bash cURL
curl https://crazyrouter.com/v1/videos/sora_task_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "id": "sora_task_abc123",
  "status": "completed",
  "video": {
    "url": "https://crazyrouter.com/files/sora_abc123.mp4",
    "duration": 10,
    "width": 1920,
    "height": 1080
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Sora Pro mode takes longer to generate but produces higher quality results. Storyboard mode is ideal for videos that require coherent multi-scene narratives.
